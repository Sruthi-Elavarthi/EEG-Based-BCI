# EEG-Based-BCI
The main purpose of the project is to provide a better life for the people who are suffering from tetraplegia or quadriplegia by detecting the movement using BCI. The aim is to build a brain computer interface which reads EEG signals, perform analysis and recognizes the body part that disabled patients are willing to move.
